# Customer_Behavior_Analysis
Data analytics project on customer behavior analysis using Python, SQL, and Power Bi.

Data Analytics Project – End-to-End Workflow
📌 Overview

This project demonstrates a complete data analytics workflow—from loading and exploring a dataset in Python, to building a Power BI dashboard and preparing insights for presentation.
It highlights skills in data cleaning, SQL querying, data visualization, storytelling, and business reporting.

📂 Dataset

Source: (Add your dataset source here – e.g., Kaggle, internal, public API)

Description: Briefly describe what the dataset contains (e.g., sales data, customer demographics, transactions, time-series, etc.)

Size: Number of rows, columns (optional)

🛠 Tools & Technologies

Programming & Analysis

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook)

Databases

SQL (PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server)

Visualization & Reporting

Power BI (dashboard creation)

MS Word / Document (analysis report)

Gamma (presentation slide deck)

Environment

Anaconda / VS Code / Jupyter

Power BI Desktop

SQL Workbench / SSMS / pgAdmin / MySQL Workbench

🔍 Project Steps
1. Load Data (Python)

Imported the dataset using Pandas

Verified schema, data types, and missing values

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Summary statistics

Univariate and bivariate visualizations

Detection of patterns, trends, and anomalies

3. Data Cleaning

Handling missing values

Outlier detection and treatment

Feature formatting and encoding

Removing duplicates and fixing inconsistencies

4. SQL Analysis

Loaded cleaned data into a SQL database

Performed analytical queries (JOINs, aggregations, window functions)

Validated insights using SQL across PostgreSQL/MySQL/SQL Server

5. Dashboard Creation (Power BI)

Built interactive visuals and KPIs

Designed filters, drill-throughs, and custom measures (DAX)

Delivered a final business dashboard for decision-makers

6. Report Writing

Documented insights, findings, and business interpretation

Summarized key metrics, challenges, and recommendations

7. Presentation (Gamma)

Prepared a clean, modern PPT-style deck

Included visuals from Python/SQL/Power BI

Highlighted problem, approach, insights, and impact

📊 Dashboard Preview

(Add a screenshot or short description—e.g., Sales KPIs, Revenue trends, Customer segmentation, etc.)

🧾 Results & Key Insights

List your 3–5 most important insights

Highlight ROI-impacting conclusions

Mention actions or recommendations based on data

Example:

Increased revenue correlated with regions having higher marketing spend

Customer churn reduced when response time improved

Majority of sales occur in Q3, suggesting seasonal patterns
